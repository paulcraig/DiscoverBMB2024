In an earlier module, there was a discussion of different ways to linearize data so that linear regression could be used, for example, taking logs of the molecular weights of protein standards to plot versus relative migration for an SDS-PAGE gel. With curve_fit, you can do a least squares regression fit for data that demonstrate nonlinear relationships."

    "You probably noticed that the curve appears a bit disjointed, because it provides values only at the selected concentrations of the substrate. A fit curve based on 1000 x-values will be much smoother. To do this, we first use the numpy linspace function to create a new list of 1000 x-values ranging from the minimum xdata value (using the numpy min function) to the maximum xdata value (using the numpy max function). Then we generate a fit curve using the MM function. We then add the experimental data and the smoothed fit data to the plot. Note that the experimental data is plotted using `'bo'`. This tells matplotlib.pyplot to use blue (`b`) circles (`o`)."

    "If you use the jupyter notebook for your python interpreter, the notebook only executes the current code block.  This can have several unintended consequences. If you change a value and then go back and run an earlier code block, it will use the new value, not the first defined value, which may give you incorrect analysis.  Similarly, if you open your jupyter notebook later, and try to run a code block in the middle, it may tell you that your variables are undefined, even though you can clearly see them defined in earlier code blocks.  But if you didn't re-run those code blocks, then python doesn't know they exist.  "
